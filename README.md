Sure, here's a basic README file for your Flask application:

# Bank Branch API

This Flask application provides an API to manage banks and their branches.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=<your_database_uri>
   ```

   Replace `<your_database_uri>` with your actual database URI. If not provided, it will default to `sqlite:///test.db`.

3. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

2. Access the following endpoints:

   - `/banks` (GET): Get a list of all banks.
   - `/branches/<bank_id>` (GET): Get details of branches for a specific bank by ID.

## API Responses

- `GET /banks` Response Format:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Bank Name 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bank Name 2"
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```

- `GET /branches/<bank_id>` Response Format:
  ```json
  {
    "ifsc": "IFSC Code",
    "bank_id": 1,
    "branch": "Branch Name",
    "address": "Branch Address",
    "city": "City Name",
    "district": "District Name",
    "state": "State Name",
    "bank_name": "Bank Name"
  }
  ```

## Notes

- Ensure you have a valid database URI configured in the `.env` file.
- This application uses SQLAlchemy for database operations and Flask for the web server.
- Make sure to handle authentication and authorization if deploying this in a production environment.
